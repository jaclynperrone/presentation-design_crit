The Pivotal Labs Design Toolbox:

# Design Critique

Jaclyn Perrone, Fall 2014

# What is Design Critique?
- time set aside weekly for designers to present their work and collect feedback

- designers pair less than often than devs, so it's important to have collab time

- coming from design school backgrounds, a lot of us missed the constant feedback loop we had among students and teachers

- crit is a way to bring back that supportive, safe and collaborative environment


---

# How does it work?
- we meet every Wednesday after lunch

- 1 hour, two 30 min slots

- on Mon/Tues weekly email with 2 things:

- "Anyone have anything they'd like to present?"

- I also include a gif of Gob Bluth

---

## Set-up

- 2 designers to present, 1 facilitator

- first designer states the project, problem, type of feedback sought


---

- team reviews design mocks pinned to wall

- and projected on the monitor

- sometimes prototypes

---

- place dots on areas of the mock we would like to talk about; heatmap!

- capture additional notes on index card

- Facilitator leads team discussion

- Using the dots to go through the mockups linearly

---

## During Critique

- focus on problems, not solutions

- let the designer solve the problems; they have way more context (and it's the fun part)

## After Critique

- designer keeps dotted mocks & corresponding notecards

- share with team and client

- incorporates feedback into their workflow

---

- decide between different approaches to a problem

- rethink layout / information architecture

- help choose topics for user testing / validation

- weight of the team's opinion validates designer's direction to client (team really excited about option A)

---

# Why do we Crit?

---

Goals

## For the Project
- open doors to getting feedback more easily

- fresh eyes are important (keeps the project healthy)

- even the act of describing a project can give one great clarity

---

Goals

## For the Designer
- get help (5 pairs of eyes)

- practice receiving feedback (good for minimizing ego)

- learn to not take it personally

---

Goals

## For Pivotal Labs Design Team
- Exposure to other projects

- practice giving constructive feedback, not solution-based

- opens door to follow-up pairing

---

Goals

## For the Client

- reassurance that many design experts would come to similar conclusions

- access to talents outside allocated designer

- talking points for stakeholder

- validation for stakeholders

---

# Who

- designers at Labs!

- PMs, anchors, other team members

- Sometimes (prospective) clients as well!

- Vanessa and James and the IDT Team

- Andreea + a designer from Quandora

- Lissa, a designer from XO

- You!

- (dev only engagement that needs design direction/feedback)

---

# When/Where

**1:30pm-2:30pm**

**B.Altman**

**every Wednesday**

---
