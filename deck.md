The Pivotal Labs Design Toolbox:

Jaclyn Perrone, Winter 2014

# What is Design Crit?
- time set aside weekly for designers to present and collect feedback
- designers pair less than devs, so its important to have collab time
- collaborative setting where it's clear everyone has a design voice

---

# How does it work?
- weekly email: "Who wants to present?"
- Two 30m slots
- I also include a gif of Gob Bluth.

## Set-up

- proctor leads the session
- State the project, problem, type of feedback sought
- review flows on-screen
- pin up print-outs of mocks

---

**(photo time!)**

## During Critique

- focus on problems, not solutions
- place dots on areas of the mock they would like to talk about; heatmap!
- capture additional notes on notecard
- proctor leads discussion

<!-- - Each of their dot has their initials, plus a number for reference (ie. JP1, JP2, etc)
- They then jot down a corresponding note on the notecard for the discussion (ie. JP1 - Unsure what this button does)
- After 10 minutes, the moderator uses the dots to lead the discussion for another 10-15 minutes (ie. Josh, you have a #5 dot over on the sign up modal...Anything you'd like to say about that)
- At the end of the session the presenter walks away with their dotted mockups and notecards to go along with them
- Then Designer 2 presents...wash rinse repeat -->

## After Critique

- photograph everything in-place
- Designer keeps dotted mocks & corresponding notecards
- incorporates into normal project workflow

---

![](images/result.jpg)

- decide bw different approaches to a problem
- rethink layout / information architecture
- the Calvary arrives! validation of professional design opinion to lay-opinion of client ("Oh, it's not just you")
- help choose testing topics for Think-Aloud Thursday
- content testing / validation
- change mocks
