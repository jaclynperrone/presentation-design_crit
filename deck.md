# Design Crit: An Investigation

---

# What is Design Crit?
- Special time set aside every week for designers to present and collect feedback about the projects they are working on.
- cross-pollination (exposure)
- create a dialog
- get help (5 pairs of eyes)
- the act of talking about a project can shed a lot of light on the project


---

# How does it work?
- I send an email at the beginning of the week, asking if anyone would like to present.
- I also include a gif of Gob Bluth.
- A designer or two will reply back and say that they are interested in showing, and then they present that Wednesday.

- All they need to do is bring print outs and a a digital copy of their design (if they have it!) to project.

# The Flow
- 1 - 2 designers present
- 30 minutes per designer, lead by a moderator
- Designer 1 pins up their mocks and gives a brief overview of the project


- Designer 1 says what kind of feedback they are looking for
- All other designers have a sheet of dots, a sharpie and a note card
- They place dots on areas of the mock they would like to talk about


- Each of their dot has their initials, plus a number for reference (ie. JP1, JP2, etc)
- They then jot down a corresponding note on the notecard for the discussion (ie. JP1 - Unsure what this button does)
- After 10 minutes, the moderator uses the dots to lead the discussion for another 10-15 minutes (ie. Josh, you have a #5 dot over on the sign up modal...Anything you'd like to say about that)
- At the end of the session the presenter walks away with their dotted mockups and notecards to go along with them
- Then Designer 2 presents...wash rinse repeat

But...
We've had some special guests!
